The input file describes a knapsack instance, and it has the following format:

[knapsack_size] [number_of_items]
[value_1] [weight_1]
[value_2] [weight_2]
...

For example, the third line of the file is "50074 659", indicating that the second 
item has value 50074 and size 659, respectively.

The input file describes a knapsack instance, and it has the following format:

[knapsack_size] [number_of_items]
[value_1] [weight_1]
[value_2] [weight_2]
...

For example, the third line of the file is "50074 834558", indicating that the 
second item has value 50074 and size 834558, respectively. As before, you should 
assume that item weights and the knapsack capacity are integers.
