The input file describes a distance function (equivalently, a complete graph 
with edge costs). It has the following format:

[number_of_nodes]
[edge 1 node 1] [edge 1 node 2] [edge 1 cost]
[edge 2 node 1] [edge 2 node 2] [edge 2 cost]
...

There is one edge (i,j) for each choice of 1≤_i_<_j_≤n, where n is the number 
of nodes.

For example, the third line of the file is "1 3 5250", indicating that the 
distance between nodes 1 and 3 (equivalently, the cost of the edge (1,3)) 
is 5250. You can assume that distances are positive, but you should NOT assume 
that they are distinct.

The format is:

[# of nodes] [# of bits for each node's label]
[first bit of node 1] ... [last bit of node 1]
[first bit of node 2] ... [last bit of node 2]
...

For example, the third line of the file 
"0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1" denotes the 24 bits associated 
with node #2.

The distance between two nodes u and v in this problem is defined as the Hamming 
distance -- the number of differing bits -- between the two nodes' labels. For 
example, the Hamming distance between the 24-bit label of node #2 above and the 
label "0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1" is 3 (since they differ 
in the 3rd, 7th, and 21st bits).
