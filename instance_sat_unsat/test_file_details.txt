# The file format is as follows. In each instance, the number of variables 
# and the number of clauses is the same, and this number is specified on the 
# first line of the file. Each subsequent line specifies a clause via its two 
# literals, with a number denoting the variable and a "-" sign denoting logical 
# "not". For example, the second line of the first data file is "-16808 75250", 
# which indicates the clause -x_{16808} V x_{75250} Â¬x16808 V x75250.
