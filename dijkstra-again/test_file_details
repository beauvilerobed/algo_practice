# The file contains an adjacency list representation of an undirected weighted
# graph with _n_ (_n â‰¤ 200_) vertices labeled 1 to _n_. Each row consists of the
# node tuples that are adjacent to that particular vertex along with the length
# of that edge. For example, the 6th row has 6 as the first entry indicating that
# this row corresponds to the vertex labeled 6. The next entry of this row
# "141,8200" indicates that there is an edge between vertex 6 and vertex 141 that
# has length 8200. The rest of the pairs of this row indicate the other vertices
# adjacent to vertex 6 and the lengths of the corresponding edges.
