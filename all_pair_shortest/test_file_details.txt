# The first line indicates the number of vertices and edges, respectively. 
# Each subsequent line describes an edge (the first two numbers are its tail 
# and head, respectively) and its length (the third number). NOTE: some of the 
# edge lengths are negative. NOTE: These graphs may or may not have negative-cost 
# cycles.
