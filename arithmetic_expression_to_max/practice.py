# Parenthesize an arithmetic expression to maxi- mize its value.

# Input. A string s = s_0s_1s_2...s_2n of length at most 29. Each symbol 
# at an even position of s is a digit (that is, an integer from 
# 0 to 9) while each symbol at an odd position is one of three 
# operations from {+,-,Ã—}.

# Output. The maximum value of the given arithmetic expression 
# among all possible orders of applying arithmetic operations.
